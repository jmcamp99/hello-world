# After Effects Holiday Scene: Campbell_Christmas

The goal of this project was to create a holiday scene with Adobe After Effects. In this project I learned how to add text, animate it,
add different shapes, and make them fade in and out. To improve this I could have done more with the background instead of leaving it black.
Also, I could have added movement to the shapes. As a reference I used this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztwm0OTPqyI](url). The video
showed me how to animate the text in an interesting way.
