# Experiment with Alice Software: Pandahare

This project aimed to experiment with Alice 3 software utilizing variables, input/output, loops, decisions, and math operations.
I knew very little about programming then, so I learned how to use a counter and an if statement.  I could have added dialogue, gestures, 
and more conditional statements or loops to improve this project.  There were no references used.
