# Create a simple game using Alice: Racing the Tortoise
The goal of this project was to create a simple game using Alice 3 software. I learned about event listeners while doing this project.
This allowed me to map the directional keys on my laptop to make the character move in the game.  I realized a big problem after 
turning in this game: the hare could go through the maze walls.  This game needs collision detection on the maze walls to prevent this.
I could have also put in some timed dialog throughout the race, as well as better camera angles and movement. There are no references
for this project.
