# Tell a short story with Alice

For this project, the goal was to tell a story using Alice 3 software.  In this project, I got more familiar with programming movement for the characters
and using text bubbles for conversation in Alice 3.  I also figured out how to move the camera and change its orientation. I could have done better
with the background, it is oversaturated in green.  I should have added gestures to the alien to add more depth to the characters.
