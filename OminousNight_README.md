# Experiment with Photoshop: OminousNight

The goal of this project was to create a composite image of four or more images using Adobe Photoshop. This project taught me the 
basics of photoshop.  I learned how to get and use Pixabay creative content with photoshop to create an original image.  To improve this
project I could have cleaned up some of the spillover from the fire onto the pavement.  I also should have realized that the shadow of
the cowboy is wrong, it should have gone away from the fire instead of towards it.  As a reference I used [https://pixabay.com](url).  
I did not save the references when I did this project so I tried to search for them on pixabay.  I was unable to find all of the images except one
