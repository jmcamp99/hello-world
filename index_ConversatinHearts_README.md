# Conversation Hearts Programming: index.html

The goal of this project was to create a webpage using HTML/CSS and JavaScript that mimics the conversation hearts on Valentines Day.
I had no experience with JavaScript prior to this.  I used W3schools to learn what I needed in order to complete the project. 
Functionally, the webpage did everything I wanted.  It would have been better if I had added more CSS to the page,
like borders, a better background, and a better color scheme. I used [https://www.w3schools.com/](url) for a reference.
